[{"content":"Introduction Hello, World! 🌍\nWelcome to the very first post on my brand-new blog, created with none other than Hugo! 🎉 It\u0026rsquo;s been an exciting journey getting this site up and running, and I’m thrilled to finally share it with you.\nAs a final year student, I’ve always been intrigued by web development, and building this blog is my way of diving deeper into the world of static site generators. After considering a variety of tools, I decided Hugo was the best fit. Fast, customizable, and built with a focus on simplicity—Hugo is perfect for creating a quick, clean blog with minimal hassle.\nWhy Hugo? If you’re new to Hugo, it\u0026rsquo;s a static site generator (SSG) that allows you to build websites quickly without worrying about complex back-end setups. You write your content in Markdown, and Hugo takes care of the rest, generating static files that can be hosted anywhere. With Hugo, you get an ultra-fast build process, and since it\u0026rsquo;s static, the site loads almost instantly!\nIn my journey with Hugo, I’ve learned a lot about how static websites work, and I thought it would be a great opportunity to build something that serves as a portfolio for my web development projects, share my thoughts on tech, and document my coding journey as I work toward landing a job in the industry.\nWhat’s Next? There’s a lot more to come! In this blog, I’ll be sharing:\nTech tutorials and coding tips for aspiring developers. Project walkthroughs and real-world examples of what I’ve been working on. Thoughts on the latest trends in web development and programming languages like Python, Django, and JavaScript. And of course, my own coding challenges, such as working through problems on LeetCode, GFG, and various open-source contributions. I’m excited about the future of this blog and can’t wait to see how it evolves over time. From now on, you’ll be able to visit and follow my journey through tech, share ideas, and hopefully learn something new along the way.\nA Special Thanks I want to take a moment to thank the creators of Hugo and the open-source community. Without them, this blog wouldn’t have been possible. If you haven’t checked out Hugo yet, I highly recommend giving it a try. It\u0026rsquo;s simple to set up, and the documentation is incredibly helpful.\nVisit the official Hugo website to learn more and start building your own site!\nConclusion That’s it for the first post. I’m looking forward to sharing more of my experiences, tips, and projects with you. If you\u0026rsquo;re also passionate about web development or just curious about the tech world, I hope you’ll stick around and join me on this adventure. And remember, no matter where you are in your journey, just keep coding and never stop learning!\nThanks for reading, and stay tuned for more!\nFaizan ","permalink":"https://faizanmohd5.github.io/posts/first-blog/","summary":"Introduction Hello, World! 🌍\nWelcome to the very first post on my brand-new blog, created with none other than Hugo! 🎉 It\u0026rsquo;s been an exciting journey getting this site up and running, and I’m thrilled to finally share it with you.\nAs a final year student, I’ve always been intrigued by web development, and building this blog is my way of diving deeper into the world of static site generators.
